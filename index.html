<p>As an emerging and aspiring software developer, I have joined a college access program called  Year Up
        that assists me with the development of both soft and hard skills to prepare for the work force. Striving to hone the essential skills to achieve my goal I am learning coding languages such as HTML, CSS, PYTHON, and JavaScript.
        
        With over 5 years of experience as a freelance social media manager, as well as 5 years of customer service experience, I have developed a strong skill set that allows me to excel in team-based and independent work environments. I have also had a wonderful opportunity to be empowered to utilize my second speaking language Somali, in order to break language barriers to support customer needs.
        
        In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, trying new food spots, watching shows, and listening to music.
        
        I'm excited to collaborate with others and make new connections! please feel free to contact me let's get connected!</p>
